        In 2020, the Rhode Island Center for the Book incoroporated as a nationwide nonprofit.
        Since then, the Center has expanded across the state, primarily through its two flagship
        programs, Reading Across Rhode Island and Kids Reading Across Rhode Island. Led by current
        director Kate Lentz, the Center's mission is to expand literacy across the state. RICFB
        is the Rhode Island branch of the National Center for the Book, which is housed under the
        Library of Congress.

    <h2> About this project </h2>
    <p> I completed this project in partnership with the Brown University Swearer
        Center for Public Service and their CEDEC (Community-Engaged Data &
        Evaluation Collaborative) initiative, which seeks to partner Brown students
        with local organizations in order to meet their data needs. The RI Center for the Book
        provided their own partnership records as the dataset, which I supplemented with existing
        RI datasets as cited in the individual charts.
