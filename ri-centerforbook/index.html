        [PUT this under a hook paragraph?] In 2018, the Rhode Island Center for the Book incoroporated as an
        independent, 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Since 2011, the Rhode Island
        Council for the Humanities had hosted and funded the RICFB
        Since then, the Center has expanded across the state, primarily through its two flagship
        programs, Reading Across Rhode Island and Kids Reading Across Rhode Island. The chart
        above the title demonstrates the steady growth across both programs since 2020. Led by current
        director Kate Lentz, the Center's mission is to expand literacy across the state. RICFB
        is the Rhode Island branch of the National Center for the Book, which is housed under the
        Library of Congress.

        The Center's Reading Across Rhode Island and Kids Reading Across Rhode Island
        programs, while diverging in book selections, share the mission to build a
        network of readers across the state with a shared base of literary knowledge.
        For KRARI in particular, the Center also hopes to help prevent summer learning
        losses among its large population of partnered elementary and middle schools. In
        addition to selecting the statewide book choice, the Center also works to provide
        thousands of copies of the selected book to schools and other partnered institutions
        for free, removing financial barriers which might otherwise stop individuals
        or entire schools and libraries from participating.

    <h2> About this project </h2>
    <p> I completed this project in partnership with the Brown University Swearer
        Center for Public Service and their CEDEC (Community-Engaged Data &
        Evaluation Collaborative) initiative, which seeks to partner Brown students
        with local organizations in order to meet their data needs. The RI Center for the Book
        provided their own partnership records as the dataset, which I supplemented with existing
        RI datasets as cited in the individual charts.
